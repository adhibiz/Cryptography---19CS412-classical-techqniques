# Caeser Cipher
Caeser Cipher using with different key values

# AIM:

To encrypt and decrypt the given message by using Ceaser Cipher encryption algorithm.


# DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Design of Caeser Cipher algorithnm 

### Step 2:

Implementation using C or pyhton code

### Step 3:

1.	In Ceaser Cipher each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
2.	For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
3.	The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the   
    scheme, A = 0, B = 1, Z = 25.
4.	Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be described mathematically as,
                       En(x) = (x + n) mod26
5.	Decryption is performed similarly,
                       Dn (x)=(x - n) mod26


# PROGRAM:
~~~
#A python program to illustrate Caesar Cipher Technique
def encrypt(text,s):
    result = ""

    # traverse text
    for i in range(len(text)):
        char = text[i]

        # Encrypt uppercase characters
        if (char.isupper()):
            result += chr((ord(char) + s-65) % 26 + 65)

        # Encrypt lowercase characters
        else:
            result += chr((ord(char) + s - 97) % 26 + 97)

    return result

#check the above function
text = "ATTACKATO
s = 4
print ("Text  : " + text)
print ("Shift : " + str(s))
print ("Cipher: " + encrypt(text,s))
